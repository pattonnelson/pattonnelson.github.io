vectorization, we have created a dataframe containing the top most important words from each poem. The darker blue represent a higher TF-IDF score which shows that these words are the most important within their respective poems. This is simply another method of exploration with this data before we begin to build and evaluate models. I wanted to see what types of words were most commonly ranked higher in terms of TF-IDF, and I can conclude that quite a few words from early modern english were ranked more important. One thing that was uncertain to me in this project was how removing stopwords for english would only work for modern english text. I didn't know how this would impact the performance in models, but now I am wondering if the inclusion of these early modern stopwords like \"thy\",\"ye\",\"thou\", will be significant in the

I found the most important words through TF-IDF and found that many early modern english words were deemed \"important\" within their respective poems. This could be helpful in classification and determining between the two styles of english. Many other important words had a relation to nature. This could be interesting for another research project. After implementing different models for classification, Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network. I utilized the tfidf vectors for these models as, to my understanding, it is best to used as opposed to Word2vec when dealing with a smaller dataset. I knew that it was most likely for the neural network to have the highest performance, but I was interested in seeing how well the Naive-Bayes model and Logistic Regression models would perform. To my surprise, both models, even the Naive-Bayes model, performed very well on this data. After proving the neural network being the highest performing model, I tried a Stratified K-Fold split to see if it would improve performance at all. I wasn't sure about the use of this as the data did not contain a heavy imbalance in classes, however it did seem to improve the accuracy overall. <br>\n","\n","A major issue that may have altered my results for this project is the lack of data. The data I was able to find was sourced from the Poetry Foundation and contained just under 600 different poems. This is not terribly small, but is still a relatively small dataset when building NLP models. <br>\n","\n","Moving forward, I would find it interesting to pursue a research project that explores the sentiment analyis surrounding poems that focus on themes of love. The most frequent word across all the poems in this dataset was \"love\". It could be an interesting question to see how models can differentiate between positive and negative sentiment when given poems with the same theme. I would like to take more time to find a more comprehensive set of poems to train the model on, as I'm sure this would make the models more fleshed out. I very much enjoyed this project, and was grateful to be able to explore a topic of my choosing."],"metadata":{"id":"BaERNUkXLEc_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"iGl8Jb4JLDyg"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
